# HackMed2020 Project

## Project Concept

A smart platform with tools that help people schedule appointments for COVID19 tests to avoid crowds and wait times. Many universities have mandatory testing for students on campus, however there is no way to schedule in advance. This results in students waiting in lines, crowding around centers, and increasing the risk of disease spread. We're trying to build a platform that allows people to schedule and let center manage their resources to minimize patient risk and help health care provider. It also reduces burden for admin cost, improves efficiency, and provides data for ML and analytics as they know how many people to expect for tests.

We're focus on making a simple UI for users and the health folk that are providing the service. We are using JavaScript (React, Node) for website design, UI, and Front-End and Python Django and Google's Firebase for the back-end, data management, and authenication. We will use APIs to take care of scheduling, admin portal, and notifications. It's full-stack project and we're geared on making a simple, usable end-product, focusing on the core product.
